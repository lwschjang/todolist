# todolist

An exercise in learning UnderscoreJS. It's just a simple to do list. You type in an item, and you can click on items in order to cross them off of the list. 

*I didn't add in any styling as this was just to practice and learn underscoreJS*

Technologies Used:

HTML

UnderscoreJS 

JQuery

Rack
